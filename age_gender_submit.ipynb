It is said the users can use up to 12 hours in row in Google Colab. But many people found they reached its limit far less than 12 hours. To minimize the risk of reaching the limit, consider the following suggestions:\n","1. Ensure you have a stable internet connection.\n","2. Carefully validate your hyperparameters before starting the training process.\n","3. Based on past experience, each model should be trained in less than 2 hours.
